# SPLIT SHIFT - 2D Action-Platformer

This project is a game developed for the IT 307W | GAME DEVELOPMENT course at Bulacan State University.

---

## About the Game

**Split Shift** is a gritty, high-octane **2D Action-Platformer** that explores the instability of two souls fighting for control of one vessel.

You play as **Jax and Axel**—brothers and underground fighters who became the unwilling subjects of *"Project Gemini,"* an illegal biological experiment conducted by Dr. Kline. Fused into a single body intended to be the ultimate covert weapon, their goal is simple but desperate: **Escape the Kline Institute.**

### How It Works (Core Gameplay)

The game is a frantic mix of **Rhythm Combat** and **Puzzle Platforming**. You aren't just fighting guards; you are fighting your own biology.

* **The Bio-Rejection System:** The shared body cannot sustain one psyche for too long. As you play, a "Stress Meter" fills up. If it peaks, you suffer from "Bio-Rejection"—your vision tunnels, audio muffles, and movement becomes sluggish.
* **The Mechanic:** To survive, you must **SHIFT** between the two brothers constantly. Shifting resets the stress meter and swaps your abilities, creating a rhythmic flow of combat and traversal.

### The Dual Protagonists

| **Jax (The Brawn)** | **Axel (The Projectile)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Role:** Crowd Control & Heavy Hitter | **Role:** Precision & Mobility |
| **Combat:** Raw, heavy punches with high knockback. Breaks shields. | **Combat:** Long-range energy bolts and AOE "Energy Flare" attacks. |
| **Traversal:** Double Jump, smashes weakened walls, forces open heavy doors. | **Traversal:** Hovers over traps, dashes instantly, activates energy switches. |
